## Map Generation
- [x] Data type setup
- [x] Prim's algorithm
- [x] Debug visualizer (Top Down)
- [x] Player Scene and Debug Player Sprite Drawn
- [x] Player Debug Sprite Movement

## First-Person Visualization
- [x] Only render considering the room that you are in *distance 0*
- [x] Render at distance of 1
- [x] Distance of 2
- [x] At furthest distance behind all walls, put a mystery shadow texture to show that that is out of sight.
- [x] Debug Map to Test Rendering

## Gameplay
- [x] Cells can hold landmarks or items
  - [x] Cells can hold an exit
- [ ] Player can pick up teeth
- [ ] Player can pick up arms
- [ ] Debug mini-map shows landmarks
- [ ] Farther side wall at distance d2 needs to have a connection of lines from the far center wall at level d2. It also needs to be 1 pixel longer on its left side. This needs to be double-checked in the testing room to see if it is actually visible. The one pixel offset thing seems to be visible, but I have yet to replicate the other issue. It would be nice to take care of though.
